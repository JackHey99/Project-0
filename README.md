Green LED datasheet
![Green LED datasheet ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53545740/63909001-4dfe3300-ca75-11e9-9df3-d3eb50594236.JPG)

Vs - Supply Voltage
Vf - Forward voltage of the LED. This is the voltage required to turn on the LED.  
If - Forward Current of the LED. This is the current required by the LED for operation.

Using the following equation a suitable series resistor value can be found.
R = (Vs - Vf) / If
Substituting the values in for the green LED
R = (3.3 - 2.4) / 20mA = 24 ohms 

Because we did not have any 24 ohm resistors available the closest value resistor was used which was 130 ohms.
