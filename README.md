Vs - Supply Voltage
Vf - Forward voltage of the LED. This is the voltage required to turn on the LED.  
If - Forward Current of the LED. This is the current required by the LED for operation.

Using the following equation a suitable series resistor value can be found.
R = (Vs - Vf) / If
Substituting the values in for the green LED
R = (
